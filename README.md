# hypertension-algorithm

During my final quarter at UCI, I made this hypertension algorithm for fun shortly after learning the basics of computer programming on my own. This simple web application serves as an interactive hypertension treatment algorithm that can accept user inputs to determine the best protocol to treat patients with hypertension. The user can enter blood pressure values, select from a list of conditions, and answer simple yes/no questions. The app will recommend different pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions based on those inputs.
