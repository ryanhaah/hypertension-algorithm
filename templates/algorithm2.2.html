    <p>Is the patient black?*</p>

    <p>*This difference in treatment was noted in the recommendations of the <a href="https://thepafp.org/website/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2014-JNC-8-Hypertension.pdf">JNC 8</a>. However, there is conflicting evidence on whether or not racial background determines the type of antihypertensive pharmacological intervention or if there are other variables that account for this difference:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="../static/papers/helmer2018.pdf">"A Review of ACE Inhibitors and ARBs in Black Patients With Hypertension"</a> — appears to support the notion that there is a difference in pharmacological treatment</li>
        <li><a href="../static/papers/palla2016.pdf">"Renin-Angiotensin System Inhibitors vs Other Antihypertensives in Hypertensive Blacks: A Meta-Analysis"</a> — does not appear to support the notion that there is a difference in pharmacological treatment</li>
